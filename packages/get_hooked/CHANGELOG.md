## 0.0.2
- Grinding out those pub points!
  - Fix a syntax error (`AnimationController.repeat` doesn't have a `count` param in stable yet)
  - Make pubspec description >= 60 chars
  - The fancy images weren't showing up… not sure if it's a security thing
    or if it was the syntax I used, but regardless I decided to split the README into
    a "GitHub-optimized version" and a "pub.dev version"
    

## 0.0.1

- Initial release!
- Introduce several cool new APIs:
  - `Get`
  - `Use`
  - `Vsync`
  - `AsyncNotifier`
  - `ProxyNotifier`
  - `ValueAnimation`
- …and other new APIs which aren't quite as cool.
